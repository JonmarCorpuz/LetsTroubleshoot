# ImagePullBackOff Overview

ImagePullBackOff means that the Pod cannot start because the container image cannot be pulled from the registry after retrying several times

# Common ImagePullBackOff Causes

## Networking Related Causes

- [ ] Incorrect registry URL 
- [ ] Unreachable registry URL
- [ ] Something is blocking the connection to the registry (*Firewall rule*, *Network configuration*, *etc.*)
- [ ] The proxy settings aren't configured properly

# Debugging ImagePullBackOff

## Check Network Connectivity

Validate that the Pods and Nodes can access the remote container image registries using commands like `curl` or `wget`)

## Check Firewall Rules 

Ensure your VPC allows outbount access to the required ports for the registry

## Check Proxy Settings 

Ensure that your configure the HTTPS proxy settings on your Nodes and Pods

## Validate Image Configurations

Check that all the image names and tags in your Pod specs are correct and match the images in the registry
```Bash
kubectl get pod
```
```Bash
kubectl describe pod <POD_ID>
```

## Pull Image Manually

```Bash
docker pull
```

## Confirm Registry is Up and Running

## Check the Registry for Requested Images

## Trace the Registry Logs for Errors

## Check Available Storage Capacity

Check the available storage capacity on a Node
```Bash
df -h
```
* If the command shows that the disk is full or has low free space, then you have to free up space in the Pod or ask for more space

## Check Disk I/O Performance

Check the disk I/O performance on the node
```Bash
iostat
```
* If the command shows that the disk I/O is high or has high latency, then improve the disk I/O performance by reducing the disk load, using faster disks, or optimizing the image size or layers

## Validate Image Pull Secret

## Ensure Service Account Has Pull Permissions
