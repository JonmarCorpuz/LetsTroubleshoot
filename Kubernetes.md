# CrashLoopBackOff

## Issue Summary

`CrashLoopBackOff` is a Kubernetes state representing a restart loop that's happening in a Pod where a container in the Pod is started, but crashes and is then restarted, over and over again

- Kubernetes will wait and will increase the back-off time between restarts to give you a chance to fix the error
- This state means that it's currently waiting for the indicated time before restarting the Pod again, which will probably fail again unless the problem has been fixed

## Error Messages

```Text
Container keeps crashing.
```

```Text
Canâ€™t restart some containers in this Pod.
```
<br>

```Text
Kubernetes restarts the Pods with an exponential delay starting at 10 seconds, for a maximum of 5 minutes, until the Pods run successfully for 10 minutes. If a problem prevents the Pods from running, your services might experience prolonged downtime.
